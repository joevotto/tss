                            When I was working for one of the big cell phone providers, I was assisting a customer over the phone.

                            She wanted to process a warranty for her non working phone. She was able to verify the account so I asked all 

                            of the warranty questions and processed the order. After finishing it, she then informed me she had 3 more to process.

                            This immediately raised red flags in my head and I put her on hold. I let my manager know what was going on and 

                            he agreed. He told me to send a security pin to either a phone on the account or the email to have her verify it. 

                            Once I took her off hold and let her know, she immediately refused and hung up the call. My TL let everyone else know of the 

                            scam and didn't hear any more from that person.

                            When I was working for one of the big cell phone providers, I was assisting a customer via chat.

                            The guy needed help finding some files on his phone. He said I am so glad I am talking to a guy. I was a little weirded out by that

                            but I let it go and went back to working on his issue. I gained remote access to his phone, and he began showing

                            me around to where he usually kept his files. I quickly found out why he was glad that a guy answered the chat.<br><br>The pictures he was trying to find were adult oriented photos that he saved from the internet. It was very awkward, and I 

                            couldn't help but wonder what he would have done if a female had taken his chat.

              Answered a chat where the customer was complaining that the hold music for their phone system at the office is looping. I was thinking, what did you expect to happen? Do you want the audio files to magically last as long as the call is on hold?

                            I was taking a chat for a big name cell phone carrier, and got a chat from a customer who wanted information on how his phone worked. I said no problem, what kind of phone do you have? After a few minutes of silence the customer replied with I don't know. Can you look it up for me? I was so confused, how do you, one, not know what kind of phone you bought, and two, have questions on how your phone works if you don't even know what the phone is? I was able to 
                            look up that info, and answered his basic questions. I suspect it won't be the last time he chats in.

                            Customer chats in stating her cordless phone is searching for base, a common problem when the handset is not registered. I asked what is the status of the lights on the base. One light indicates if there is a handset registered, the other indicates power and the third one indicates if the base is connected to ethernet. She told me to wait while she looks for it. I wait a few minutes for her to come back to the chat. When she finally comes back, she tells me that I dont have the base. That would be my problem. I moved offices and didn't take that part with me. So sorry! She then ends the chat. I started laughing right away.
                            At least she admitted fault and apologized. Thats a rarity. I hope she can get that back, they are expensive.

                            Customer wanted us to get a new toll free number for their office, and we were discussing how she wanted it set up. She seemed very confused on how this number would operate in comparison to the non toll free ones on their account. For some reason, she thought this phone would have some special
                 capabilities, and was shocked when I told her its just a phone number, it's not anything special, unlike her.

                    Do you want me to snap my fingers? Instead, I asked, do you have an ethernet cord for this phone? She replies with No. So I'm like, kill me now. I told her you will need an ethernet cord to plug it into the router. She replies with Oh, Ok and ends the chat. I proceeed to bang my head on the wall.

                        Customer contacted support because her phone tree was not letting people leave a voicemail. A phone tree is also called an IVR. When you call a business and hear press option 1 for this, 2 for this, etc, that is the phone tree. I ask her what option should lead to voicemail, and she said I called and the phone tree didn't lead to a beep. I was really confused on what she meant because phone trees never lead to any type of beep. After some more investigative questions, turns out, lord knows why, she thought that phone tree was voicemail. I had to tell her that phone tree is not voicemail so it won't go to voicemail. If she wants it to go straight to voicemail, I can remove the phone tree. This led to a long 10 minutes of silence while her two brain cells overheated, she then said nevermind and left the chat. I hope I was able to get to the root of that problem.

We have never offered non voip phones. How do

                            Another chat with someone who has a non-working cordless phone. Just like last time, I asked her what the status of the lights were to see what the issue might be, and then she informed me that 
                            “It doesn’t need to be plugged into the internet, it’s wireless.” It was at this point I banged my head into the wall.
